# Getting Started

## Expectations and requirements
To get started with any new idea, we ask that you answer one simple question in 2–3 sentences: “What problem are you trying to solve?” 10x and the TTS Director will vet ideas to determine which projects best fit within the TTS areas of focus. If your project is selected, it will enter Phase 1 of the investment process.


### Characteristics of projects

#### We're looking for ideas with evidence of the following:

- Your project is in a big or rapidly growing market within the government.
- Your project supports not just the government but also the contracting ecosystem.
- Your idea directly impacts other government agencies or the American public.
- Your team is prepared for the unique challenges of developing a new product or service within the government.

**Your project fits into at least one of the five TTS areas of focus:**

- Cloud
- Online services and tech-enhanced services
- Information security
- Acquisition
- Analytics



**What is the experience like?**
- Making it through the funding and development process requires a significant investment of time. We need to do our due diligence to make sure we’re good stewards of taxpayer dollars, so you and your team will need to be able to show the value of your project and continue to develop your idea to receive funding at each stage. 10x projects can require a significant investment of time to be successful - be sure to plan accordingly!
