# Our process

### How does the 10x process work?

10x is the management vehicle for the Digital Services Fund, a portion of the Federal Citizen Services Fund designated to support new, good-for-government products and services. 10x invests the money appropriated into this fund into new ideas with the potential for significant impact across the government. TTS will support these products and services until we find a permanent home for them within GSA or another agency.

10x is an incremental investment fund inside the federal government, which is a fancy way of saying that we start by giving you a smaller amount of money, with an expectation about what the output of spending that money should be. We use your results from that investment to determine whether or not to give you an additional, larger amount of funding for the next phase of work.
