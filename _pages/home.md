## What is 10x?

10x invests in products and services that possess groundbreaking ideas or technology with the potential for significant return on investment. We’re aiming for 10 times the value of the initial investment to the federal government or the American public, measured through cost savings, improved efficiencies, or scale of impact.

10x funds products and services that scale widely or affect a significant portion of the U.S. population, whether or not the projects are cost-recoverable. Our approach is based on modern venture capital practices and is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while also ensuring that the best products and services get funded.


### How is 10x different?

#### Traditional Way
The government budgets for new technology by specifying a lump sum of money for a project to be spent over a period of months or years.

This sometimes leads to spending money on projects that shouldn’t continue simply because the budget already exists.

#### 10x Way
10x attempts to spend the smallest amount of funding necessary at each stage of a project to determine if it’s worth pursuing.

Only one or two of every ten projects selected for funding will move into design and development work.

This iterative approach allows the government to save money while ensuring that the products and services funded meet a real, verifiable need in the federal marketplace.
