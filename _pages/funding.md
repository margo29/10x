# Funding

There are five separate funding phases:

**Phase 0 - Ideation**<br/> Write 2–3 sentences to answer the question: “What problem are you trying to solve?” If your project is selected, it enters our investment process.

**Phase 1 - Investigation | $20k in FY2018** <br/>This phase is designed to quickly uncover risks, roadblocks, and opportunities for the project. You will have 2–3 weeks to explore the idea and define what it would take for it to be successful.

**Phase 2 - Discovery | $175k in FY2018** <br/> A weeks-long research effort to develop a detailed understanding about the industry, problem, product and market fit, finances, timeline, regulatory environment, how you scale, and so on. The team will think comprehensively about what could go right and wrong, and will develop an initial strategy around each issue the project may face.

**Phase 3 - Development | $650k in FY2018** <br/>Develop the product or service and begin to narrowly focus on a long-term sustainability strategy. This phase includes the development of a functional minimum viable product (MVP); at least one customer actively using the product; a product roadmap tied to a customer acquisition strategy; a long-term funding model; a data-backed market analysis and strategy; and a viable estimate of cost and effort required to design, build, deploy, and maintain the product over time.

**Phase 4 - Scale | $1.28m in FY2018** <br/> If necessary, additional funding to help you significantly increase the number of people using the product.
